# All other steps are combined as follows. Currently step 3 has not been implemented.
	
# STEP 3:

# Here I am supposed to calculate the Question Concept matrix again fromm the original one. QC'. Rules are:
# 	CASE 1 : if two or more non zero values in column C_t of the original questions-concept matrix QC, then new element is the fraction of what that question contributes to that concept with respect to the contribution of all the other questions.

#	CASE 2 : if just one non-zero element, then take that only.


# STEP 4:

# Here, we actually calculate the relevence between two concepts. formula is : 
#	rev(C_i, C_j)_(Q_x ----> Q_y) = qc_(xi) * qc_(yj)' * confidence(Q_x ----> Q_y)
	

# STEP 5:

# calculate u = min of every element of the QC matrix 
# if rev (calculated in step 4) < u, then calculate e_(ij) = N_i + N_j
# N_i : no of questions for concept i
# N_j : no of questions for concept j
# if e_(ij) < no of questions * 0.5, then preserve the relevence even if it is less than u.

# STEP 6:

# If all conditions are met and the associative rule is correctly learned to correctly learned, then it is concept2 to concept1
# If all conditions are met and the associative rule is incorrectly learned to incorrectly learned, then it is concept1 to concept2
